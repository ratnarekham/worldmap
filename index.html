            The number of nuclear weapons in the world increased this year for the first time in decades,
            as China tripled
            its nuclear arsenal to 600.
        <p>This increase is one of the reasons why the scientists moved the Doomsday Clock, which warns about humanity's
            danger of self-destruction, closer to midnight than ever before. </p>
        <p>The UK had already increased the limit on how many nuclear weapons it holds from 225 to 260.</p>

        <p>A 2024 study found that almost three quarters of Ukrainians want them back.

            believes Ukraine could have protected itself better.</p>

        <p>"It was too binary—either give up nukes or not, without considering options in between," Budjeryn argues.</p>

        <p>“We have to keep telling and recording our stories to let people know what happened” insists Satoshi Tanaka,
            a
            member of the Nobel Peace Prize winning survivor group Nihon Hidankyo.</p>

        <p>The 81-year-old survivor of Hiroshima is concerned that amid the rise of nuclear risk, people who can tell
            stories of what happens when the weapons are used are dwindling.</p>
        <p>There used to be at least over 370,000 in 1980. Now, there are only just over 100,000. “It is said that in
            ten
            years, there will be no survivors left”, says Satoshi.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-out">
        Satoshi Tanaka entered the
        destroyed city of
        Hiroshima the day after the bombing at 1 year-old. His family and relatives suffered injury and illness due
        to
        radiation, and he had lost eleven of them, with one missing. When he was a university student, he faced a
        discrimination against him when a flatmate asked, “are you sure the atomic bomb disease is not infectious?”.
        And
        since in his fifties, he suffered from six cancers. He, along with many survivors today, are afraid of
        cancers
        and illnesses that might strike. And with the rising nuclear threat, Satoshi says “they are not old stories.
        It
        is continuing today”.
